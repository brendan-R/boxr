## Authentication using OAuth2

There are two steps you have to follow to get up-and-running with **boxr**:

1. Establish a Box application that will work with your Box account.
2. Authenticate your Box account using your application. 

Once you have completed these steps, `box_auth()` should *just work*.

To use **boxr**, you need to enable API access for your Box account. The process is slightly annoying. You only need to do it once - it takes around 2 minutes.

### Authorizing from a local computer

#### 1. 'Create New App'
Go to [https://app.box.com/developers/console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), (when you are logged in) and click on the button 'Create New App', which will guide you through four screens to create your new app.

* On the first, select **Custom App** and click 'Next'.
* On the second, select **Standard OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)** and click 'Next'
* On the third, choose a unique name for your app, this can be anything and click 'Next'
* The fourth screen should be a confirmation of successful creation, click 'View Your App'

#### 2. Set OAuth2 Parameters

'View Your App' will take you to the **Box Developers Console** and where you will be in the **Configuration** sub-menu by default. Scroll down to **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI** and set it to `http://localhost` and be sure to click 'Save Changes'.

Keep this browser window open because you will need the client_id and client_secret for the next steps back in `R`.

#### 3. Connect boxr to your account
This means passing your client_id and client_secret to the `box_auth` function. These strings are not enough for someone to access your account maliciously. However, it's still a good idea to keep them safe, and out of any files or code which might be shared with others.

Run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(boxr)
box_auth()
```

And paste/type the `client_id` and `client_secret` when prompted. If these are valid, a browser window should open, for you to formally grant yourself access to your files at box.com.


#### 4. And you're done
If `box_auth()` worked successfully, you won't need to do any of this again, and thanks to the magic of `httr` everything should *just work*. Your client_id and client_secret will be securely stored in your R environment variables, your hashed OAuth2.0 token will stored at `~/.boxr-oauth`, .gitignore'd if necessary, and automatically refreshed when needed. If you would like to automatically authenticate each time the package is loaded, consider running `box_auth_on_attach(TRUE)`.

### Managing your client id & secret

To make you following authentications easier to, you may wish to put your client id and secret into your `.Renviron` file:

```bash
BOX_CLIENT_ID="youridhere"
BOX_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecrethere"
 
```

Please make sure that your `.Renviron` file ends with a newline.

## Basic operations

Functions that operate on Box files or folders have arguments: `file_id` or `dir_id`. You can use the [box.com]() web interface to find these values. Although they look like numbers, it is perhaps simpler to think of them as character strings:

![**Box file id**](figures/box-file-id.png)

![**Box folder id**](figures/box-folder-id.png)

Here are a few of this package's functions: 

* `box_dl(file_id)` and `box_ul(file = 'path/to/file')` to download and upload files 
* `box_setwd()`/`box_getwd()` to get/set a default box folder
* `box_load()`/`box_save()` for remote R workspaces
* `box_read()` to read files straight into R (e.g. CSV or Excel files as `data.frame`)
* `box_source()` to read and execute remote code
* `box_write()` to write R objects to Box files
* `box_search()` to query files stored on Box
* `box_add_description()` add text descriptions to your Box files 

### Directory-wide operations

Cloud storage services can complement version control systems for code, which aren't well suited to large binary files (e.g. databases, .RData, or heaps of pdfs). box explicitly versions binary files, keeping old ones, and making it easy fall back to an older copy.

boxr provides *git style* facilities to upload, download, and synchronize the contents of entire local and remote directories. At the time of writing, the box.com API does not support this directly, and so boxr recursively loops through directory structures.

![Synch a whole directory!](figures/boxr-console.png)

* `box_push()` will update the remote directory with new/changed local files
* `box_fetch()` will update the local directory with new/changed remote files

These functions all have `overwrite` and `delete` parameters, which are set to `FALSE` by default.

**Disclaimer:** box.com is no replacement for a VCS/remote-database, and familiar verbs are no guarantee of expected behavior! Do check the function documentation before jumping in.

### Piping

boxr's functions have been designed to be 'pipable'. Here's a little example:

```r
library(boxr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

# 'nycflights13.json' is the same as nycflights13::flights, if you want to
# follow along at home

box_auth()

box_search("nycflights13.json") %>%                # Find a remote file
  box_read() %>%                                   # Download it as a data.frame
    group_by(origin, dest, month) %>%              #   Do some, er, cutting edge
    summarise(mu = mean(arr_delay), n = n()) %>%   #   analysis with dplyr!
  box_write("delay_summary.xlsx") %>%              # Convert to .xlsx, upload
  box_add_description("Check out these averages!") # Add a description to your file!

```
