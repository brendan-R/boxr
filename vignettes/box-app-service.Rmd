# this is a bit of a hack - this code is at the start of *each* of the vignettes;
# I would prefer that it appear once

# We want to keep a *single* copy of the figures for the entire site. The 
# reference copy of the figures is in the package directory `man/figures`.
# The first thing we do in this vignette is to copy that directory 
# to an the `vignettes`

To interact programatically with the Box API, i.e. to use `boxr`, two things have to be done:

1. A Box application (app) has to be set up.
2. You have to authenticate to the app.

There are two different types of apps, contrasted in this [overview vignette](./box-apps.html). In this vignette, we discuss the service-app, which is designed for unattended use, e.g. generating a daily report. The service authenticates to this app using a JWT (JSON) token, then accesses Box through this app, with the privileges associated to the app (which should be minimal).

How you use this vignette depends on your Box set-up; we cover these situations:

1. Someone in your Box organization has already created the service-app for your purpose. This means that you have been issued a JSON file which contains the JWT authentication-token. If that's the case, you need only the first section of this vignette, focused on users.

2. You have to create a Box service-app, meaning you you have to create the JWT authentication-token. In that case, you will need the second section of this vignette, followed by the first section.

Please keep in mind that if your Box account is controlled by an organization, e.g. you use Box at work, the creation and use of Box apps may be controlled by your Box-admin team. If this is the case, you might refer them to this vignette as a part of a request to have an app created.

```{r}
library(boxr)
```

## Stashing here for now

Becasue of how Box structured these apps, they can be capable of performing actions as *any non-admin user* within its associated enterprise. Currently there is [no way to restrict app abilities/access to only specific users](https://community.box.com/t5/Platform-and-Development-Forum/Restrict-service-account-permissions-to-specific-users/td-p/35984). Although `boxr` provides functions for file-based actions, rather than user-based actions (like creating/deleting users), if your JWT token becomes compromised, there is nothing stopping the token from being with other tools.

If you are setting a JWT app up for a personal account, this is not really an issue. But if you are doing this for a company account, this means the app *could* access sensitive information from another user account (eg payroll, HR records, etc.) if it was provided with the relevant user ID and a valid private key file. Note: Box provisions user IDs by time the account was created, so if a batch of accounts was created together (say when the enterprise account was initialized) they will have sequential user ID numbers.

## Authorizing from a local computer

**1. 'Create New App'**

Go to [https://app.box.com/developers/console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), (when you are logged in) and click on the button 'Create New App', which will guide you through four screens to create your new app.

* On the first, select **Custom App** and click 'Next'.
* On the second, select **Standard OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)** and click 'Next'
* On the third, choose a unique name for your app, this can be anything and click 'Next'
* The fourth screen should be a confirmation of successful creation, click 'View Your App'

**2. Set OAuth2 Parameters**

'View Your App' will take you to the **Box Developers Console** and where you will be in the **Configuration** sub-menu by default. Scroll down to **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI** and set it to `http://localhost` and be sure to click 'Save Changes'.

Keep this browser window open because you will need the client_id and client_secret for the next steps back in `R`.

**3. Connect boxr to your account**
This means passing your client_id and client_secret to the `box_auth` function. These strings are not enough for someone to access your account maliciously. However, it's still a good idea to keep them safe, and out of any files or code which might be shared with others.

Run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(boxr)
box_auth()
```

And paste/type the `client_id` and `client_secret` when prompted. If these are valid, a browser window should open, for you to formally grant yourself access to your files at box.com.


**4. And you're done**
If `box_auth()` worked successfully, you won't need to do any of this again, and thanks to the magic of `httr` everything should *just work*. Your client_id and client_secret will be securely stored in your R environment variables, your hashed OAuth2.0 token will stored at `~/.boxr-oauth`, .gitignore'd if necessary, and automatically refreshed when needed. If you would like to automatically authenticate each time the package is loaded, consider running `box_auth_on_attach(TRUE)`.

## Managing your client id & secret

To make you following authentications easier to, you may wish to put your client id and secret into your `.Renviron` file:

```bash
BOX_CLIENT_ID="youridhere"
BOX_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecrethere"
 
```

Please make sure that your `.Renviron` file ends with a newline.
