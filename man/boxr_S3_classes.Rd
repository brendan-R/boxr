\title{boxr S3 Classes}
\description{
boxr has a few very simple S3 classes for the data returned by the API.
While \code{\link[=httr]{httr()}} returns objects in it's own system of classes,
generally boxr extracts information, and converts the JSON response to an R
list with httr::\code{\link[=content]{content()}} (perhaps with some information judged
to be extraneous removed). If you'd rather get to the list itself, you can
do this with  \code{unclass(x)}.

The following classes are used:
\itemize{
\item \code{boxr_file_reference} -
Returned by \code{\link[=box_ul]{box_ul()}}, and similar functions (e.g.
\code{\link[=box_save]{box_save()}}). A description of a file remotely hosted on
box.com. Available methods: \code{print}.
\item \code{boxr_folder_reference} -
As above, but for folders/directories. Available methods: \code{print}
\item \code{boxr_object_list} -
Returned by \code{\link[=box_search]{box_search()}}, and related functions. A list,
with each entry being a reference to a file or folder hosted on box.com
. Available methods: \code{print}, for a summary of the first few
results, and \code{as.data.frame}, to coerce some of the API response's
information to a \code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame()}}.
\item \code{boxr_dir_comparison} -
Returned by the internal function \code{\link[=box_dir_diff]{box_dir_diff()}}. Available
methods: \code{print}, \code{summary}.
\item \code{boxr_dir_wide_operation_result} -
Returned by \code{\link[=box_fetch]{box_fetch()}} and \code{\link[=box_push]{box_push()}}.
Available methods: \code{print}, \code{summary}
}
