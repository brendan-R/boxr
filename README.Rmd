# boxr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

A lightweight, high-level R interface to the box.com API, standing on the shoulders of [`httr`](https://github.com/hadley/httr).

[Box](https://www.box.com) is a cloud content-management and file-sharing service. The goal of the **boxr** package is to make it easier for you to conduct data analyses that interact with your Box account.

## New in boxr 3.5

A few words here on:

- new authentication method
- refurbished documentation
- new maintainers
- ...

## Installation

You can download boxr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boxr), with:

```R
install.packages("boxr")
```
 
If you'd like to download the development version from GitHub, use:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-box/boxr")
```

### Documentation

The packge-documentation website is created and maintained using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org). Upon the CRAN release for version 0.3.5, the documentation website will consist of:

- a [CRAN-version site](`r url_site()`)
- a [development-version site](`r url_site("dev")`) 

Until the CRAN release for version 3.5, the most-current version of the site will be the [development-version site](`r url_site("dev")`).  

## Usage

We have a [Get-started article](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html")`) that goes into more detail on interacting with your Box account using R.

### Authorization

This can be the a little tricky to set up, but once it works, going forward, it should *just work*. As detailed in the [article](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#authorization")`), there are two use-cases:

- authorizing from R your local computer
- authorizing from R on a remote server

Once you have made the configuration, you can use `box_auth()` to renew your authorization for your R session.  

### Basic operations

* [Accessing Box directories](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#accessing-box-directories-folders")`): `box_setwd()`, `box_getwd()`, `box_dir_create()`, `box_ls()`, `box_push()`, `box_fetch()`
* [Accessing Box files](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#accessing-box-files")`): `box_ul()`, `box_dl()`, `box_previous_versions()`, `box_add_description()`
* [Searching Box](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#searching-box")`): `box_search()`

### Advanced operations

* [Using Box trash](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#using-box-trash")`): `box_delete_file()`, `box_delete_folder()`, `box_restore_file()`, `box_restore_folder()`
* [Interacting with your R session](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#interacting-with-your-r-session")`): `box_read()`, `box_write()`, `box_source()`, `box_save()`, `box_load()`

## Alternatives

Other ways to interact with a Box account include:

* The [Box desktop apps](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads)
* The *other* boxr, [written in Ruby](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr). Its motivations are rather different, and it covers 100% of the box.com API (e.g account administration, etc.)
* Box themselves provide a [wide range of SDKs](https://github.com/box), including [one for Python](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk)

## Contributing

Always very welcome! If you'd like to submit a pull request for a new feature, ideally it would be documented, come with an addtion to [NEWS.md](`r url_site("news/index.html")`), and have a test or two. This project has a standard [Code of Conduct](`r url_site("CONDUCT.html")`).
