# boxr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

A lightweight, *opinionated*, high-level R interface to the box.com API,
standing on the shoulders of **[httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr)**.

[Box](https://www.box.com) is a cloud content-management and
file-sharing service. The goal of the **boxr** package is to make it
easier for you to integrate your Box account into your R workflow.

## New in boxr 0.3.6

In this release, we add new some functions and supersede others in an
effort to harmonize function-names. In fact, this will likely be a theme
going forward. You can use new (or newly-named) functions:

-   to manage collaborations (sharing files and folders):
    `box_collab_create()`.

-   for file-operations: comments, and getting versions:
    `box_comment_create()`, `box_version_history()`.

-   to read and save RDS files stored at Box: `box_read_rds()`,
    `box_save_rds()`.

-   to browse to file or a folder: `box_browse()`.

Importantly, there is also a meta-improvement: all API calls
automatically retry upon failure - thanks to [James
Lamb](https://github.com/jameslamb) and the [Chicago R Community
Collaborative](https://github.com/chircollab)!

Other changes are detailed in the
[NEWS](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/news/).

## Installation

You can install boxr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boxr), with:

``` r
install.packages("boxr")
```

If you’d like to install the development version from GitHub, use:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-box/boxr")
```

### Documentation

The package-documentation website is created and maintained using
[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org). The documentation website consists
of:

-   a [CRAN-version site](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/).
-   a [development-version site](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/dev/).

## Usage

We have a [Get-started
article](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html) that goes into
more detail on interacting with your Box account using R.

### Authentication

If you have access to `client_id` and `client_secret` for a Box-app, you
can use `box_auth()` to authenticate:

``` r
box_auth(client_id = "your_client_id", client_secret = "your_client_secret")
```

This will kick off a process that, all being well, will keep you
authenticated for the rest of the R session. By saving this information
to your `.Renviron` file, at your next R session you can use, without
arguments:

``` r
box_auth()
```

If you don’t have access to `client_id` and `client_secret`, you should
read the [authentication
article](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr-apps.html) to
determine your next steps. In most cases, this next step will be to
create an [interactive
Box-app](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr-app-interactive.html)

### Basic operations

-   [Accessing Box
    files](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#files):
    `box_ul()`, `box_dl()`, `box_version_history()`.
-   [Accessing Box
    directories](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#directories):
    `box_setwd()`, `box_getwd()`, `box_dir_create()`, `box_ls()`,
    `box_search()`.
-   [Directory-wide
    operations](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#directory-wide-operations):
    `box_push()`, `box_fetch()`.

### Advanced operations

-   [Interactng with Box
    files](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#box-file-interaction):
    `box_collab_create()`, `box_comment_create()`,
    `box_add_description()`.
-   [Using Box
    trash](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#using-box-trash):
    `box_delete_file()`, `box_delete_folder()`, `box_restore_file()`,
    `box_restore_folder()`.
-   [Interacting with your R
    session](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#interacting-with-your-r-session):
    `box_read()`, `box_write()`, `box_read_rds()`, `box_save_rds()`,
    `box_save()`, `box_load()`, `box_browse()`.

## Alternatives

Other ways to interact with a Box account include:

-   The [Box desktop apps](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads).
-   The *other* boxr, [written in
    Ruby](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr). Its motivations are rather
    different, and it covers 100% of the box.com API (e.g account
    administration, etc.).
-   Box themselves provide a [wide range of
    SDKs](https://github.com/box), including [one for
    Python](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk).
